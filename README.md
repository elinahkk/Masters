## Masters thesis work by E. Khasandi ##

The following Repo contains Data and iPython notebooks for my masters thesis.

The focus of the study is on analysis of daily precipitation, minimum, and maximum temperature characteristics, seasonal climatologies and their extremes using observed in situ data. In addition the study assesses the capability of the Co-ordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Rossby Centre Regional Climate Model - RCA4, Regional Climate Model (RCM) to simulate the observed climate exttrems of the region. 

The same code is modified accordingly for the analysis of maximum and minimum temperature.

GHCN_Data_Analysis is the main notebook to look at. 

Different notebooks that focussed on CORDEX ouptuts will be commited soon.
